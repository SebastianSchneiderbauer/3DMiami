# DO NOT touch this. At all. This is your ONLY WAY to revert to a normal save. 
# If you want to "manipulate" your game, change the CURRENT save file. The name of it should be "save_data.txt" 
# If you have no current save file, start the game once, it will create one.
# Hope you are having fun with Project:REDLINE, greetings from HerrKleiderbauer :)
